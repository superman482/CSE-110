## **About me**

I discovered programming very late, but I have had a fascination with computer since I was four years old. 

As of my history being a programmer, I have never done an actual project ever in my life. However, I have done some interesting small codes in the past.

1. Functions of a turn-based game similar to Pokemon
2. GUI and graphics for that turn-based game.

One of my hobby is playing online games with my friends and some offline games. Some of my favorite games I have played are:

- Muck[^1] `#000000`
- Lost Ark
- Dead Cells
- Monster Hunter World
- Phoenix Wright

My favorite quote from my favorite philosopher:

> **Every morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.**

This quote reminds me to keeps being a better person than who I was yesterday.
